# HOPE
This is a series of jupyter notebooks that were used to generate all figures for the HOPE modeling manuscript.

Additional data and modeling files (MONOLIX) are available from the authors and licenses would be required to rerun and regenerate the raw data that is used in the jupyter notebooks. Please email dreeves@fredhutch.org for more information.
